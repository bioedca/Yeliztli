"""G6PD deficiency X-linked pharmacogenomic context API — SW-E6.

A read-only, context-only, sex-aware summary of the array-typeable G6PD
deficiency variants for a sample — see ``backend.analysis.g6pd``. Additive only:
it emits no diagnosis, changes no finding's evidence level or ClinVar
significance, and writes nothing back.
